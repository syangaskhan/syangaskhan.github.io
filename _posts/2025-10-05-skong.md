Oh my god it's already October. Where has the time gone!?
Let's look back at what I said I wanted to work on last month, and see how much of that I actually got done...

1. Davis square puzzle adventure _scouted a few new locations_
2. Library puzzle adventure _did absolutely nothing on this_
3. Hollow Knight PuzzledPint _did absolutely nothing on this_
4. Strak sequel _did absolutely nothing on this_
5. Kpop Demon Hunters fanfic _did absolutely nothing on this_
6. Fantasy writing project _did absolutely nothing on this_

Wow, I'm at 0.5/6, if we decide to count the couple of photos I took of random spots in Davis Square. 

So, what have I been doing?

I've been playing copious amounts of Silksong. It's such a satisfying game, and there's clearly so much detail that went into all of it - the beautiful art, the haunting music, all the characters with so much backstory. I'm excited to continue exploring Pharloom (and ignoring all my other creative projects, lol).

I _did_ manage to pull myself away from the game long enough to finish a short story, which I'm hoping to edit and polish up before submitting to a couple of magazines. Wish me luck!
