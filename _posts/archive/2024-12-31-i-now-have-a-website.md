I've toyed around with the idea of having a landing page for my stuff on the internet for a long time now, and this holiday season, I figured I'd go ahead and do it!

It's quite possible the only person who will ever read these posts is myself. I've thought about that a bit, and I'm okay with that - it'll be fun for me in to come back and read these old posts in a couple of years. Hello, future me! I hope we are doing well.

If you are not me, thank you for coming to this little corner of the internet! I hope you enjoy your stay :)
