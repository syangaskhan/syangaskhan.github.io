I've decided to be more intentional about keeping track of what I've read this year. In that vein, I've started a little 2026 book journal on Instagram, as well as tracking my books on Storygraph more diligently. 

So, onto this story that blew my mind. I was checking the Discworld AO3 at the end of last year and came across what seemed like a pretty good fanfic which had just been recently completed (after two years)! So I bookmarked it and figured that I would read it...someday, since my TBR backlog of books is already ridiculously long.

Cut to last month - I was on a long flight, finished two of the four books that I'd pre-loaded onto my Kindle, and the other two were just not speaking to me. So I flipped to the fanfic - [Strange Medicine](https://archiveofourown.org/works/51791533?view_full_work=true) - and found myself immediately hooked. 

The fic is such a lovely homage to Sir Terry Pratchett, and it made me laugh and cry in equal measures. It explores deep themes, but also manages to stay lighthearted and doesn't take itself seriously. AND, it has ~_illustrations_~. 

I guess this isn't some super long introspective blog post like I usually do. All I can say is go read it!! Now!! It is so good!!
