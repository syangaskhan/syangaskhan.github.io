The first post of 2026! Exciting. 

When I was younger, I daydreamed about becoming a published author. I remember gazing longingly at the library shelves, imagining what it would feel like to see one of my books there. Of course, I had no idea what I was going to write. I think back then, I was more obsessed with the idea of _having written_ rather than writing. Which is a whole 'nother blog post in itself, haha. 

But interestingly enough, in all those daydreams, I never imagined that it would be _my_ name on the cover. I spent more time thinking up different pseudonyms - all incredibly white-washed, mind you - than actually writing. 

Now, why would I do something silly like that?

The answer was simple: I simply didn't see any Asian names on the library shelves. As such, my ten-year-old brain leaped the logical conclusion: that there wasn't a place for someone like me on the shelves.

Now that we're 15+ years later, I'm extremely happy that there are so many more varied authors that are being published. Books in non-European settings are everywhere now. I think my first foray into them was [Spin the Dawn](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/bfb62cf1-3ab3-4d09-9ea6-f8cd52df0daf) by Elizabeth Lim, a gripping Mulan meets Project Runway mashup set in an absolutely gorgeous Asian setting. More recently, I've read books like Leanne Yong's ["Two Can Play That Game](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/66f69d63-2327-45af-98cf-ee5f391bceb6) and Gene Luen Yang's [Lunar New Year Love Story](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c9ed1ac4-3cc4-443c-a857-c7c7de3a6981) that showcase Asian cultures so well and make me feel so _seen_. I only wish that there had been more books like those while I was growing up.

Anyways, all that to say - representation and diverse role models are so important in the world of creativity. I'm so glad that we're getting more of it!
