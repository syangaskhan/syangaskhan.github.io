Just a quick wrap-up of how my year went!

My family likes to spend time setting New Year's Resolutions and doing sort of an audit on how well we accomplished our previous ones. I usually try to not set too many goals so that it's not overwhelming, but it's really easy to get overly ambitious. 

## 2025 New Year's Resolutions:
### Goals:
[x] be able to do a single chin-up 
[x] run a 5k
[x] write a short story

### Habits:
[ ] meatless mondays [was good at the beginning of the year and forgot during the summer]
[ ] tech-free tuesdays [forgot about this entirely]
[-] daily meditation [kept falling off the wagon]
[-] daily gratitude journal (>300) [only did 238] 

### Challenges:
[x] flip-phone february (<2hr usage per day)
[x] social media-less summer (no social media starting June 1st)
[ ] no buy november [completely forgot about this]

All in all, not too bad. I'm going to try and keep it up next year!

## Resolutions for next year:
### Goals:
[ ] be able to do a single pull-up
[ ] run a half-marathon (5k is acceptable, especially if i get injured again)
[ ] finish the first draft of Strak's Bad Date

### Habits:
[ ] daily meditation + gratitude journal (>250 days)
[ ] cook more next year (>40 times)
[ ] meatless mondays
[ ] do more Ys + Ws and neck exercises (>200 times)

### Challenges:
[ ] social media sundays - only check social media on sundays
[ ] no-buy november - don't buy things in november
[ ] flip phone february - <2 hr phone usage per day
[ ] try something new every month
