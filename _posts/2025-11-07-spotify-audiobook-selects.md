So...I've got some incredibly exciting news! [Strak's Bad Day](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2S7KL94?dplnkId=d033ee90-d709-4d1a-be8a-c59a8388a4c8) was just published as a brand-new audiobook with the [Spotify Audiobook Selects program](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-10-16/spotify-audiobook-selects-first-indie-releases/)! It's available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0B0vMrunhawfemrHOdaIht?si=17dd8cf4316743e8) (free with Premium!), and everywhere else you can get audiobooks - Libro.fm, Audible, Barnes and Noble, Apple, etc. I've embedded the preview here if you'd like to give it a listen:

How did this come about? Well, I saw that Spotify was launching a [new audiobooks publishing program](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-03-13/spotify-audiobooks-launches-a-new-publishing-program-for-independent-authors/) and I thought I'd throw Strak's Bad Day into the ring. I then promptly forgot about it, because usually what happens with these things is that I get a rejection 5+ months later, and this program explicitly said that it would not notify people who hadn't been chosen.

Imagine my elation when I got an email with an offer! The Spotify Audiobooks Selects team was absolutely amazing to work with - so patient, friendly, and enthusiastic. It was so awesome to hear my characters brought to life by the inimitable John Pirhalla, who absolutely _nailed_ Strak's voice. 

So yeah! I'm really excited. I am so grateful for the opportunity to share Strak's story with more listeners. I hope people like it! 

p.s. I still don't feel like a _real_ writer. Maybe it just never happens :P
