title: hello impostor syndrome my old friend
author: Stephanie Y. Yang

As a former PhD student trained in the trenches of academia, I have a complicated (and long) relationship with impostor syndrome. Even now, I feel like I've fooled the world into thinking that I'm a capable scientist that knows what she's doing.

So, of course, it only makes sense that impostor syndrome would stretch its horrible grasping tentacles into my hobbies as well.

Here's a confession: I've never considered myself a writer. Even now, you'll notice that in the "About Me" section, I'm a "person who dabbles in writing", not a "writer". (Or maybe by the time you're reading this, I've mustered the guts to change the About Me to say that I _am_ a writer; one can hope!)

Why is that, you might ask? 

Let's talk about moving goalposts.

When I was younger, I wrote a lot for fun. The only people who ever read my stories were...well, me. (And thank goodness for that, I produced a lot of complete garbage). During that time, my main thought was as follows: "I'll be a _real_ writer if other people read my work!" 

Then came middle school, where I discovered the beautiful world of fanfiction. I _devoured_ fics, and pretty soon, I found myself writing my own. For a time, I was part of the lovely Fire Emblem fanfic community, and people were reading my work. But then I pushed the goalposts back: I would only be a _real_ writer when people read my original work. _Not_ fanfic.

I wrote a few pieces of original fiction in college, however, nothing I was proud enough to show to other people. But once I'd graduated, I began participating in the (/r/WritingPrompts)[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/] subreddit - a truly incredible community, with supportive and encouraging redditors. At this point, people were reading work - _my_ original work. Still, that wasn't enough for me.

I would only be a _real_ writer if I could get paid while doing it. 

After finishing graduate school, I tackled this hurdle. Thanks to a heads-up from a friend, I got a cool gig with a company, developing their existing projects and IP. But the project I worked on was cancelled before it was published, and that gave me an out and a new obstacle: publishing. I would only be a _real_ writer if I was published.

I've finally cleared that hurdle with self-publishing my first novella. But I still don't _feel_ like a writer. I still haven't been traditionally published. I still haven't written a full-length novel (or at least, one that's intelligible - my Nanowrimo projects are shoved into a dusty, dark, corner of my computer, and I'm too frightened to touch them). 

But at this point, I've realized that there will _always_ be that insidious voice in the back of my head, listing out all the reasons why I'm not a _real_ writer yet. And when I've been more vocal about it, my friends and family, have been amazing in helping me tell that voice to go shove it.

Maybe I won't ever feel like a _real_ writer. 

And that's okay.
