As an avid reader of fantasy and sci-fi since childhood, I love getting lost in a good story. Over time, I started writing my own stories, and recently completed my first novella!

Strak’s Bad Day is a whimsical sci-fi adventure that comes with a side of soul-searching. It’s the first novella I’ve ever completed, and I’m quite proud of it! It’s available as an eBook on Amazon and Kobo.
